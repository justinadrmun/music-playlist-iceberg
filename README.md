# spotify-playlist-iceberg
The `spotify-playlist-iceberg` application visualises albums in a Spotify playlist as an iceberg. Try the app [here.](https://spotify-playlist-iceberg.streamlit.app/)

By providing the url of a Spotify playlist, this app will fetch album data from the playlist (including track popularity and album art) and overlay albums accordingly within tiers. Albums are ordered according to popularity scores from left to right. 

*It should be noted that the placement of albums on the iceberg is purely based on track data within the playlist.*
